## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added

- Methodology document at `docs/methodology.md` — process backbone + hybrid review + verification pyramid + incentive layer.
- Companion docs: `incentive-mechanism.md` (reputation math), `installation.md` (per-host setup).
- Go libraries under `internal/`:
  - `agent`: ed25519 keypair generation, on-disk registry (~/.tribunal/agents/), role enum, rotation.
  - `ledger`: signed Finding / Resolution types, canonical-JSON signing, append-only JSONL store, reputation calculation with exponential decay + family-diversity bonus, gate decisions.
- `tribunal` CLI: `init`, `agents {add,list,show,rotate}`, `ledger {summary,leaderboard,find,verify}`, `review` (stub for v0.2).
- 7 installable skills in `skills/`: `tribunal-{intent,plan,implement,review,verify,classify,incentive}` with the canonical methodology workflow.
- 9 installable agents in `agents/`: `tribunal-{pm,architect,implementer,reviewer-arch,reviewer-sec,reviewer-perf,adversary,classifier,qa}`.
- End-to-end demo at `examples/go-fizzbuzz-verified/` — intent doc, implementation, table-driven + invariant + fuzz tests, and a populated `.tribunal/` directory with 4 signed findings + 4 signed resolutions across 6 agents.
- `cmd/seed-fizzbuzz-demo/` — deterministic seed generator for the demo; CI verifies the seed is byte-stable.
- GitHub Actions CI: gofmt, vet, build, test (race detector) on Linux + macOS; CLI smoke test; example module test; demo-determinism check.

### Not yet implemented (v0.2 / v0.3)

- Multi-model adversary dispatch via `external-model-mcp` / `lm-studio-mcp` (v0.2).
- Full verification pyramid orchestration (v0.2).
- Burnt XION CosmWasm reputation contract + chain settlement (v0.3).
